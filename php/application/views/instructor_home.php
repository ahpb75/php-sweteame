<button onclick="location.href ='Instructor_controller/show_app';" id = "applicant_button"> View Applicant</button>

<!--Wanted to use JS but have to link it correctly with code ignighter
<button id = "applicant_button" >View Applicant</button>
<script type = "text/javascript">
    document.getElementById("applicant_button").onclick = function(){
        location.href = "Instructor_controller/show_app";
    }

use this instead.
    form open -- just have a submit button to call back to the controller to load the function/different view. Similar to log in the login view and register view
